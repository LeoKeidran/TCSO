# TAC - Tetarti [Venin synchronisé]

[Retour à la page principale](../../index/fr/index.md)

***Ces conseils s'appliquent à toutes les opérations qui impliquent Tetarti.*** <br>

It's like Atlus wanted to include Simons says! This GUILT strain is generally straight forward, but requires a stable hand, more so than the other strains. <br>

## Diverticula

The abscesses that appear on the start of nearly all Tetarti operations, except for 6-3, must be removed prior to the real fight starting with Tetarti itself. You should always inject the **yellow** serum first into the yellow diverticulum, followed by the **green** serum and finally **purple**.
 <br>
 This order is the fastest, and ensures that the individual polyps do not expand beyond a singular stage. <br>
 The process for extraction should be as follows: Inject approximately 1/4 of a dose, excise. Repeat until all three are dealt with. Then drop onto the tray and patch up. You should tap the gel on each membranes to be optimal. <br>

In the event you hit the wrong cell with an injection, be ready to inject and extract the abscess before it gets too large. It is better to pass up a cycle by extracting, than to watch the patient's vitals plummet. You should treat them in the same way as above in the pre-wave. <br>
 
## Injections

The injections themselves aren't too tricky if you've got a stable hand. That being said, Tetarti's hitbox is notoriously small and deceiving. You should aim to inject towards the centre of their head, where the arms meet the body. <br>
The dose is incredibly small, at most you only need to draw a quarter of a syringe. <br>
While not 100% optimal, to ensure you inject enough per Tetarti cell, you should hold A until the injection automatically stopped. The more you do this, the more you can gauage when this finishes. <br>
Before a wave starts, draw one colour. Always do this before the wave, that way you aren't wasting time. Aim to draw the same colour consistently so that you can go for the same colour as soon as possible without giving it any thought. <br>

Tetarti will often get very close to one another, making it awkward to inject the right colour, even with a steady hand. To combat this, you should wait a few moments for them to spread out. Tetarti generally will never overlap directly onto one another, and will bounce off at the same angle they meet at, often doing a 180, like they would at the organ barrier. <br>

## Vitals

Each miss you get drops the vitals down by 5, which isn't much but when done multiple times as you desperately try to inject each cell, it can result in you scrambling to boost the vitals up. <br>
Between each wave, you have space to inject at least one full dose of stabiliser without causing extra use on the syringe. This is far more important when dealing with 5-4 and 6-3. <br>
Aim to practice Tetarti to the point where you are missing less than four times per individual cell. <br>

## Mutation

In 6-3, Tetarti is a tad harder as now you have no way to read the colours until the vapours come from each individual type. <br>
Like in the other operations, you should have a dose already in the syringe before each wave starts, however when the colours are not displayed you will have to wait until it appears. <br>
This in itself isn't too difficult, and if anything the gas makes it easier to identify colours on the fly. <br>
Note however the that vitals drop much quicker, so be sure to boost between waves. <br>
Derek will make a hum in Japanese, and a groan in English when you are half way through the Tetarti phases. <br>
Overlap is a large concern in this operation, so be sure to wait longer than normal for Tetarti to spread out a little if it is too hard to tell which one is emitting which coloured gas. Note if you take too long however, you will need to reinject the dose. <br>
