# GUILT - Deftera [Creeping Tumours]

[Back to Main Page](../../index/eng/index.md)

***This advice applies to all Operations that involve Deftera.*** <br>

Deftera only occurs twice in the game, however both times it acts as a massive gatekeeper to the entire run. Understanding how Deftera works can help you aim to control it, however keep in mind its random nature can make it difficult to tame, and even with all the practice and guidance in the world, ultimately Defetera will do as it pleases. <br>

## Priority

The scariest part about Deftera is when it all goes wrong, when the vitals plummet and you can't seem to get it under control. First and foremost, if you need to use the healing touch, do so. It isn't the best idea as you have to wait even longer for the pairs to meet, however it prevents you from losing the patient and redoing the operation. <br>
Deftera itself doesn't cause much vital loss, not until you are on the final stage of extraction. Instead, the tumours that it creates over time (and when opposite pairs meet) are what really kill that patient. If left alone they create more smaller tumours. If a large tumour exists, it will begin creating smaller tumours. Make it your top priority to laser these off. <br>
The blood pools that form in 6-7 aren't that dangerous. **However** they do prevent you from treating what is underneath them. If you are waiting or need to get to a tumour underneath it, drain the blood. <br>
Draining a pair while they are merged should be almost as important as lasering tumours. Given that to complete the operation you need to extract the Deftera pairs. <br>
If you are simply waiting for Deftera to merge and there aren't any tumours, boost the vitals. <br>

## Vitals

Speaking of vitals, you will either find that vitals stay stable throughout, or that you are struggling to keep them up. This is due to the random nature of Deftera, in that the tumours cause a lot of vital damage, especially when there are a lot of them clustered up. To ensure they don't drop too quickly, you should ensure you laser off the large tumours, then the mini tumours. <br>
When on the final stage of Deftera, after the drain, you need to excise it as quick as possible. If done optimally the vitals should only drop around 20 vitals. This will be exasturbated if you are slower at excision, and lasering the tumours that are created. <br>
To excise a Deftera pair as soon as possible, I'd recommend cutting around them before the incision line appears, this way you are already doing a circular motion. <br>
It's possible to go for a double extraction, but note that this costs upwards of 60 vitals to execute safely. This is because with each "pulse" that Deftera gets in, the vitals plummet, and the tumours create a large mess that cause even more vital loss. The double extraction is also incredibly risky on 6-7 where the blood pools spawn. Or else you risk [what happened to IrisJoker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlSR_997Kc0). <br>

## Gel

If you have played Under the Knife, using the gel might seem like a smart idea to control Deftera, and it can be but it has to be done very very liberally. The gel causes the vitals to drop in larger chunks. <br>
If you wish to use the gel, tap it right in the path of one of the Deftera cells, to cause it to bounce. This is often slightly random in nature. <br>
After draining Deftera, or while it is beginning to merge, surrounding it in gel can sometimes be useful to prevent other cells from interrupting the pair. Due to the gel mechanics, this isn't 100% consistent, but if the vitals are high enough this can be beneficial to ensure you can extract one pair. <br>

## HP Stages

Deftera itself has three stages beore it can be fully extracted, with each successful drain causing the colours to become more saturated, and when a pair meet, they are collectively more yellow. <br>
When dealing with two pairs of Deftera, it can help to keep them at different stages, as they cannot merge and only pass through one another. If you are finding that Deftera is regularly bumping and not letting up, staggering their health stages can make this easier. <br>
Note that even if they are different HP values, when a pair is merging, it can still be interrupted by a singular cell bumping the merging pair. <br>

## Tumours

Realistically, this is what drains the patient's vitals. In 3-4, where you are first introduced to Deftera, you will have to laser four tumours, this is the only time they'll appear before a wave. <br>
Singular cells of Deftera will spawn their relevant coloured tumour (yellow for red, and dark blue for blue) at a semi-random interval. It's important to laser these as soon as possible to prevent smaller tumours from spawning off of these. <br>
While the larger tumours cause more vital damage, allowing the smaller tumours to spawn will cause in further damage over time. <br>
The small tumours *cannot* cause more tumours to spawn, and so the larger tumours should be your first priority, followed by the smaller ones after. <br>
When Deftera is going beserk as you attempt to extract it, depending on your speed a tumour may also spawn. Ideally, you should deal with this last to allow the membranes to disappear for marginally faster clean-up. <br>
