# GUILT - Paraskevi [Arrow to the Heart]

[Back to Main Page](../index.md)

***This advice applies to all Operations that involve Paraskevi.*** <br>

This strain tests your precision more than anything, and your sutures. Given how time sensitive Paraskevi is, it can be nerve racking especially while on the heart, but there's a few tricks we can employ to make this easier. With practice, Paraskevi can become incredibly cathartic. <br>

## Lasering & Priority

As difficult as it sounds, it's important not to chase Paraskevi's tail when attempting to stun it, as you're highly likely to burn the laser out. And if you can't stun it as it is about to burrow you're either having to move organs, or you've lost the patient if it is on the heart. Tap the laser to reduce how much laser you use and aim for where the tail connects to the rest of the worm, so your laser strikes it more consistently. <br>

The goal here is to extract one half of Paraskevi, while leaving the other half completely alone. The rule of thumb is: "Attempt to extract the smallest possible segment. If it does not exist, split the smallest, until you can." This means you focus purely on the smallest segments, and ignore the largest segments unless it is about to burrow. <br>
If however you are on the final few segments, it can be beneficial (if the vitals are high enough) to split multiple worms at once. This is best for the segments with two cuts left, where in cutting it will create two worms that must be cut one last time before extraction. This leaves you with four segments to remove which, depending on your skill, should be relatively easy to handle. <br>

Paraskevi itself on average begins burying after 6-7 seconds once split. Once the tail shakes, you have three seconds to stun it before it buries. Keep in mind that it can be longer or shorter than this before it shakes its tail. Thurler has made [a video](https://youtu.be/ZxlZJ0aO-Wg) covering this in closer detail. <br>
With this in mind, you do not have to constantly tend to the largest segment, and only need to periodically laser it to ensure it does not bury.  <br>
When Paraskevi is about to burrow, Angie or Victor will warn you with a voiceline, alerting you that you have three seconds until it burrows. <br>

## Vitals

Every time you split a segment of Paraskevi, the cuts will deal 5 damage to the vitals on Normal. <br>
The killer however is leaving these cuts alone. It's best practice to suture these cuts as soon as possible, to prevent the vitals from ticking down further. <br>

At the beginning of the op, there are a few cuts that need suturing before Paraskevi itself emerges. You should be able to boost the vitals to max before Paraskevi emerges. <br>

If performed optimally, you will likely end the operation with very few vitals. <br>

## With Kyriaki

When accompanied by Kyriaki in 6-4, it can be difficult to know what to prioritise. However, as Paraskevi is purely based on timers, it is critical to extract it as soon as possible. <br>
At the start when the single segments appear, you should suture any cuts that are made and extract them right away. <br>
On the final wave when the Mature Kyriaki spawns, the Paraskevi should still be your priority once the cuts have been sutured, given that 6-4 is performed on the heart and even one burrow results in the operation failing. <br>
