# Trauma Center: Second Opinion
<div align="justify">

This guide aims to cover the Speedrunning Strats we employ within Second Opinion to shave off time as well as make operations as easy as possible.
Note that a lot of advice covered below makes the assumption you know the game reasonably well. This does not fully cover each exact step needed to complete the operation, only the optimisations compared to playing casually/safe. This also has the expectation you are running on Normal. Easy and Hard have adjusted strategies that root themselves from the standard Normal routing.
There is a lot to cover in this, so I have broken down each area into it's own collapsible section.

So much of Trauma Center: Second Opinion (TCSO) is just practicing, and getting comfortable with the game mechanics. Being able to open the patient within 2 seconds, bandaging without missing, resisting the urge to vital boost mindlessly. A lot of this will come with time. Don't worry if you're making little mistakes. This guide is aimed to all skill levels to bring to light the strategies we use, and tid-bits of information that you might not know that will help you get better.

I also want to add in here, that just like learning an instrument, starting off slow and ensuring you get the motions down are equally as important as your knowledge. If you start slow, you can build up your speed as practice goes on.

As with most speedruns, getting the core-mechanics of the game down will immediately improve your time. Below are the points I'll cover to help you get this down, and how each thing impacts your run as a whole.
- Sensor Bar
- Tool Switching
- Healing Touch
- Menuing, Text Skip, and Episode Select Skip (ESS)
- Autosave
- Gel and Bandages
- Posture, Stretching, and Breaks
- Vitals
- Routing & Region Differences
